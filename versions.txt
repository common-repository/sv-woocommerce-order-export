license update: We've decided to add a copyright notice into website's footer for a small range of domains of our direct competitors. If you are affected (which means you are a direct competitor of us), please contact us for a full refund. Removing copyright notice is absolutely prohibited except by deinstalling the plugin - removing would result in a license and/or copyright violation. Most users will not be affected, but those who are will know why.
